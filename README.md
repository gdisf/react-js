# Intro to React + Redux

## Setup

### Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sara-gudeman/gdi-react-redux.git
```

If you would like to save your work on your own GitHub repo, fork it first, then clone the fork.

### Set up your environment
This workshop uses npm 5.1.0 and node v8.11.3. If the start instructions don't run below, you might need to install a new verison of node.

Check what versions of node + npm you are running:
```sh
npm -v
node -v
```

If you are not running npm 5.1.0 and node v8.11.3, install node v8.11.3:
```sh
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

Verify you are running the correct versions.

### Starting the repo:
Run:
```sh
npm install
```

After that has completed, run:
```sh
npm start
```

Once Webpack has finished building, go to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).
You should see a page with the text 'Hello GDInsta!'
